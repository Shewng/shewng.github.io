                <p>In the stale haze of my Montreal apartment, gazing up at the succulent stretched across my window, I'm transported. The year is 1726—this is Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. 
                    Shipwrecked on the island of Lilliput, where everything is miniature, Gulliver must reconsider the impositions inherent to his size. 
                    More than a metaphor for the current moment, it's the story that gave name to the smallest cactus species in the world: Blossfeldia liliputana. 
                    When I visited Echo Park's Cactus Store—better known by its neighbors as Hot Cactus—back in early March, co-owner Christian Cummings showed me several variations from their new greenhouse collection. 
                    "In their habitat they're very hard to see," he said, tracing the fissures with his pointer finger, "but if you look closely, you'll see they have a very beautiful flower."
                </p>
                <p>Alongside friends and fellow plant-enthusiasts, Max Martin and Carlos Morera, Cummings and the team at Cactus Store have built both a community and cult-following sharing the backstories of rare desert creatures. 
                    They’ve extended that knowledge into their 2017 book, Xerophile: Cactus Photographs from Expeditions of the Obsessed, and with a line of merch ideal for staying home and showing love to mother nature—including a t-shirt featuring a fluffy white cactus, of which all proceeds went to Bernie Sanders’ campaign.
                </p>
                <p>On the morning of Sanders’ presidential resignation, I called up Martin to talk about finding comfort in caring for plants. 
                    I told him I had just acquired an “International Euphorbia Society” hoodie, to which he reminded me that “retail therapy is real,” and plants are not something disposable—their beloved selection is still available for order on their web shop. 
                    They’ve been keeping busy taking turns nurturing them, and gathering photos of personalized gardens from all over the globe. 
                    Here, Martin and Cummings share more on their ever-growing appreciation for the natural world.
