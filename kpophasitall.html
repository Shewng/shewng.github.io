                <p>Learning how to organize is like learning how to kiss—when you’re starting out, it’s safest to practice among friends. 
                    Before their power was mobilized against presidencies, K-pop fans practiced collective action on their own turf. Before Tulsa, there was the Black Ocean.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>The rumblings of a legendary fan uprising began in September 2008, in the weeks leading up to the biggest annual event in South Korean pop—the Dream Concert, where 70,000 fans gather to watch dozens of artists perform. 
                    Seating at the Dream Concert has always been a political affair, with seats distributed to fan groups in blocks based on the popularity of their idols—an arrangement that gives just a few fan clubs the power to control the crowd. 
                    In 2008, the most popular artists were the dashing boy groups TVXQ, SS501, and Super Junior. Armed with the knowledge of their numbers, their fans formed an informal union. 
                    They called themselves CARTEL, a portmanteau of their fan club names. Their goal—like many unions that have come before them—was sabotage.
                </p>
                <p>There was a new girl group on the scene, and veteran fans felt that the up-and-coming Girls' Generation, with their girl-power theme songs and pink light displays, needed to be taken down a peg. 
                    So on that fateful September night, CARTEL staged a 70,000 person coup. When Girls' Generation took to the stage, there were no colored lights, no cheers, no coordinated fan chants. 
                    Instead they walked out into an abyss, now known as the “Black Ocean.”
                </p>
                <p>For eight agonizing minutes, every light that shone through the crowd went dark. When the nine teenaged members of Girls' Generation opened their mouths to sing—trembling, their voices shaking, their synchronized movements slipping in and out of coordination—they were met with silence. 
                    When the crowd finally started to make some noise, they chanted, seemingly spontaneously, not for Girls' Generation, but for their rivals, the Wonder Girls.
                </p>
                <p>Though Girls' Generation would eventually recover from this psychic death, the first Black Ocean was an act of coordinated vandalism. 
                    Its object was to crush the dreams of teenaged girls and their fans, hardly a cause worth celebration. But the methods of this demolition were giddily, spectacularly effective. 
                    It proved what politicians and police departments are now learning: that fan groups within K-pop are prepared to mobilize and capable of executing a plan when driven by unifying passion.
                </p>
                <p>My first introduction to K-pop came ten years after the Black Ocean, at the start of 2018, after hearing that Jonghyun, a pop star who had broken out as a soloist after initial success with the boy group SHINee, had committed suicide. 
                    I immediately set out to learn more about this singer, whose final music video had the same eerie, elusive power as Aaliyah’s “Rock The Boat”—a beautiful, erotically ambiguous face suspended in cosmic metaphor.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>“The candy-colored chaos of K-pop music videos has a kind of anarchic resonance—fun can only come after reality and memory have been thoroughly obliterated.”</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The outpouring of grief at Jonghyun’s death recalled Rudolph Valentino, Leslie Cheung—deaths so tied up in the very idea of tragedy that they demand mourning become a full theatrical production. 
                    I wanted to understand how fans had managed to get billboards of Jonghyun placed in the Seoul subways, how votes were being whipped on his behalf for Korea’s daily competitive music shows, and why any of this organization even existed in the first place. 
                    The more I watched, the more the unflagging energy of these efforts became a source of boundless fascination. Jonghyun’s fans organized for months and years following his death, culminating in a push to stop Twitter from removing his public profile—the rare protest against Twitter policy that actually won. 
                    Understanding the world that surrounded Jonghyun required understanding an entire industry. As a fan of both infrastructure and classic Hollywood-style studio systems, I was a goner. 
                    I fell for K-pop and its fans and never looked back.
                </p>
                <p>For K-pop neophytes, it’s easy to see the outcomes of obsession, but not the meticulousness that sustains it. As someone who is not Korean and does not speak the language, I became acquainted with the platforms used by international fans to keep up with the news. 
                    Getting into K-pop was the most purely futurist experience with the internet I’ve ever had—log in and a new universe appears, fully formed and always growing. 
                    On Twitter, I started following Korean fansites and Korean-to-English fan translators, who labor for free to provide up-to-date records of new performances and subtitles for international audiences who want to follow along. 
                    I looked to forums like OneHallyu and r/kpop for daily gossip, and I quietly lurked on private KakaoTalk chats that were started by fans who didn’t want to post their gossip publicly. Once immersed, it became clear the relationship of international fans to the Korean music industry is not without its strains, some of them severe. 
                    Black K-pop fans have been subjected to virulent racism, largely from fellow fans who spit venom on anonymous boards like CuriousCat. 
                    There have also been incidents of racism and ignorance from stars, with performers donning blackface or appropriating styles and symbols from other cultures. 
                    In these cases, watch as the gears of cross-cultural communication flip a switch to operate in reverse. International fans post their critiques, which translators courier back to the Korean music companies that manage stars, in hopes of educating their idols and obtaining a proper apology. 
                    In this economy of traded understanding, no amount of context is ever enough. Politics and cultural histories pass between fans as quickly as pictures, the only satisfying answer to the plea embedded in the K-pop lover’s discourse: “I want to understand.”
