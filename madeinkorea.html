                <p>South Korea isn’t slowing down when it comes to cultural innovations—in fact they are leading the way in pop music, cinema, and political organization. 
                    That energy also extends itself to fashion. With trend cycles at a crossroads and industry production transforming under the burdens of our new reality, designers are under immense pressure to deliver. 
                    But for these brands, holding our attention is something they’ve already learned how to sustain, through unlikely design elements, and nods to European minimalism, despite their total independence from old guard approaches. 
                    For a better sense of the scene in Seoul, we sent Korea correspondent, Elaine YJ Lee, to gather intel—spanning formative design years through to philosophies on fashion—from five of the most vibrant brands coming out of Korea. 
                    Here, the brands’ designers and creative directors discuss how they approach their work, and share some thoughts on what’s in store for the future.

                <h3>Keenkee</h3>
                <p>Keenkee is the brainchild of Hyoungkee Kim, who got his start as a graphic designer and amateur boxer. 
                    After studying at Yale, Kim worked as a producer at MTV before art directing for Prada, which left him with the urge to make his own clothes. 
                    Now a solo operation, Keenkee is Kim’s creative outlet to externalize his unique, future-forward, fluid aesthetic.

                <h3>Post Archive Faction</h3>
                <p>Treating clothes not as a means to simply dress one’s self but rather as standalone objects to behold, Post Archive Faction’s approach is to analyze and experiment with garment properties, creating new forms of wear. 
                    Co-founder and creative director Dongjoon Lim leverages his academic background in industrial design, to deconstruct and identify clothing patterns—both technically and philosophically—resulting in what the brand calls its own “structural formula.” 
                    Kendrick Lamar supported Post Archive Faction when it first launched in 2018, and now, the likes of Virgil Abloh and GoldLink shop the brand personally.

                <h3>Martin Kim</h3>
                <p>Matin Kim is already a well-known label among locals in Korea, popular for its chic casualwear at affordable prices. 
                    After finding commercial success with Matin Kim, founder and creative director Dein is realizing her true dreams of running a formal fashion brand with the launch of Kim Matin. 
                    While it’s common for high-end labels to release secondary lines to reach a wider audience, Kim Matin’s case is the opposite. 
                    Out of a budget-friendly line emerges a premium label, more perfectly capturing Dein’s worldview and aesthetic. 
                    She credits Berlin as the city that inspires her most—Dein moved there in her early twenties to be with her boyfriend, now fiancée. 
                    Something of a mirrored love story, Dein runs Kim Matin with the same devotion she has for him and the city itself.

                <h3>pushBUTTON</h3>
                <p>pushBUTTON has been called the Peter Pan of Korean fashion. Despite being one of the most veteran brands from Korea, pushBUTTON stands out for its forever young attitude. 
                    Since its founding in 2004, creative director Seunggun Park has applied his love of the 80s to his kitschy collections, which have garnered a steady fanbase of local celebrities and international buyers. 
                    After stints as a K-pop singer, model and stylist, Park came full circle with pushBUTTON, which now represents South Korea at London Fashion Week.

                <h3>Andersson Bell</h3>
                <p>Since its launch in 2014, Andersson Bell has emerged as one of the most successful brands to come out of South Korea. 
                    Filtering Scandinavian design inspirations through the Korean perspective, its collections always adhere to the study in contrasts, offering garments that are both visually and conceptually unique. 
                    With an expanded flagship store in Seoul and an ever expanding team, Andersson Bell is set to take over the world as the next big thing representing South Korea.
