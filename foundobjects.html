                <p>Although she’d deny this, there’s a cult of personality around Maia Ruth Lee, the Lower East Side artist, mother, partner, and educator. 
                    I’ve known Maia since before she gave birth to her now 2-year-old son, Nima. (While pregnant, she walked the runway for Eckhaus Latta at New York Fashion week, unintentionally creating one of the most talked-about moments of the season.) 
                    Along the way, I had my son Jack and we shared not only the difficulties of parenting but those of making other things meanwhile.
                </p>
                <p>In 2017, Maia received an unexpected call. The man on the line told her she was the recipient of the Rema Hort Mann Grant—a prestigious award given to emerging artists in New York City. 
                    “I almost hung up,” she said of her disbelief. A year later, she’d have a solo show at Jack Hanley Gallery and be included in the 2019 Whitney Biennial.
                </p>
                <p>Maia’s art hints at a life of upheaval with a deep respect and interest in her homelands. The daughter of Korean missionaries, Maia moved around a lot. 
                    Her parents would go on assignment every couple of years as Bible translators and linguists. One mission sent them to a small village in Papua New Guinea, but Nepal remained home base for most of her childhood. 
                    She moved to New York in 2011 after meeting her husband Peter Sutherland—an artist, photographer and pillar of the NYC skate community—during an overseas photography workshop she put together for local children.

                <hr>
                <p>Maia’s sculptures bring to mind her peripatetic childhood: replicas of luggage seen at the Kathmandu airport made of plaid or check printed tarps, fades of colors tied up shibari-style with thick ropes on all sides. 
                    There are also assorted wrought metal shapes or “glyphs”—as seen in this year’s Whitney Biennial show—an automatic alphabet of found symbols salvaged from a metalworking shop, the help of only fire and welder. 
                    “The idea is that the pieces guard and protect households and spaces,” she said of the objects in an interview with The Creative Independent, “but it’s also about barriers as well. 
                    Conceptually I was really into the idea of working with a physical structure that protects but also divides people.” Aside from a video edit room or foundry, most of Maia’s work is made at the 36-year-old’s studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn. 
                    Aside from her art practice, Maia is also the director of Wide Rainbow, a non-profit that helps local girls in the greater New York City area learn about the visual arts alongside working female artists (past participants have included Jamian Juliano-Villani, Anicka Yi, and Tau Lewis) and guided museum or gallery visits. 
                    I met with Maia in Tribeca in late November to talk about her childhood in Nepal, her intuitive approach to work, and using luggage as a medium.

                <h3>Maia Ruth Lee's Dialogue during the interview</h3>
                <p>Up until I was seven, it was utter confusion. Creativity came a little later for me. We moved a lot: Papua New Guinea, Singapore for a year, then Nepal. We were a really tight-knit family. 
                    Until then, I’d been homeschooled and only spoke Korean. I remember it being international day at school and you were supposed to come in costume and carry your country flag. 
                    I didn’t understand the assignment and no one could find a Korean flag, so I paraded with the Swiss one.
                </p>
                <p>That video specifically is about memories and motherhood. The writing that I edited into the video spans over 10 years, then jumps to all the different stages of pregnancy and then after I had Nima. 
                    The video is an old survey video of Nepal that my dad shot in 1988 as our family trekked through the Himalayas and he narrates the mundane details. 
                    I appropriate pseudo subtitles to go with the pace of his speech, but it has nothing to do with translation.
                    Koreans will know instantly that it’s not a direct translation. Otherwise, the viewer will think the speech is being translated into subtitles that are my writing, but in actuality, it is not.
                </p>
                <p>And also the separation between me and my parents, between religion and culture, their lack of understanding, but also my lack of understanding of them. 
                    The video talks about my fear of being a mother. Growing up I never wanted to be a mother. The text is from a journal of notes to myself that I wrote long ago to my future child, things that I wish my parents had told me, “tools.”
                </p>
                <p>The glyphs are discarded metal scraps from fences and windows that I gathered all over New York in different boroughs and metal shops. If you think about it, they are parts of structures, about safety, protection, but about boundaries too. 
                    I’d put them together to make these symbols. It was very intuitive, everything made on site. The welders give me 15 minutes to compose them. There are no sketches.
