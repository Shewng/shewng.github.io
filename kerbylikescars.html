                <p>Kerby Jean-Raymond is a car guy. He has a need for speed, or rather, he seeks that almost winged, accelerative rush. But there’s also the calm that comes with the high. 
                    That singular hum—fulfillment. Jean-Raymond has felt this way since buying his first car at a police auction. He was 15 years old. A champagne gold 1986 Mercedes 300E. 
                    Freedom is the word he uses to characterize that new-car feeling: “It was me stepping into adulthood. I had a car in high school which was very rare in Brooklyn.” 
                    For Kerby, driving replicates the sort of solitude and heritable agency he first experienced as a child, riding in the backseat of his family’s car, listening to his parents, Jean-Claude Jean-Raymond and Vania Moss-Pierre. 
                    “They never fought in cars,” he says. “I felt safe.” There were also the times he sat on the passenger side, assisting his father—an electrician who would install stereos in drug dealers’ cars. 
                    These cars were Kerby’s objects of desire.
                </p>
                <p>“I'm realizing how all these things contributed to who I became,” he explains over an early lunch at a restaurant in the basement of a Brooklyn hotel. 
                    “For me, seeing the Pathfinders with the BBS' on them and seeing the Acura Legends with the gold emblems, with the chrome wheels—that was a better life.”
                </p>
                <p>In 2015, I saw Jean-Raymond transform behind the wheel. We were riding in his old Audi R8—he now alternates between an Aston Martin Superleggera, McLaren 720s, and a Porsche GT3RS—through Brooklyn to his aunt's Haitian restaurant on the west side of Manhattan. 
                    We moved swiftly through the city, as Jean-Raymond relaxed into the rhythm of the road. His speech, I noticed, became less guarded, the heaviness of his Brooklyn accent softened: on the road, he is vulnerable. 
                    The street, like the runway, is big with focus and pageantry, like the tensions that underpin his work.
                </p>
                <p>Jean-Raymond is hesitant to admit what cars have meant to him. In a culture where we are expected to monetize every aspect of our lives and turn passions into side hustles, the vehicles he takes pride in remain Jean-Raymond’s pure diversion. 
                    They have brought him a sense of community, among the men and women who belong to the various car clubs he frequents, and an escape from his day job: Creative Director of Pyer Moss, the label he founded in 2013. 
                    In that role, he has shown what ambition can do, by positioning himself at the center of New York fashion.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Pyer Moss represents a different kind of vehicle for him—one by which to search the past for forgotten Black trailblazers, prosecuted and slain figures such as Trayvon Martin and Ota Benga (whose story of being put on display in a human exhibition at the Bronx Zoo in 1906 served as the inspiration for Jean-Raymond’s SS16 collection), and Black cowboys like the 19th-century, original Lone Ranger, Bass Reeves (who was the subject of celebration during his FW18 “American Also” collection). 
                    Pyer Moss services the runway to reframe history and heritage, making fashion—so often accused of being too concerned with a démodé sense of materiality—now synonymous with the fruits of organized, empowered community. 
                    The motley crew of Black celebrities who have worn Pyer Moss, like Michelle Obama, Rihanna, Tracee Ellis Ross, Colin Kapernick, Lena Waithe, Chris Paul, and Wendy Williams, embody a shift in the culture, represent a growing community of people who, in Jean-Raymond’s words, “know better.”
                </p>
                <p>At the table, Jean-Raymond shakes his head, full of short, dark, messy locks, as a way to bat away my musings about cars being tied to man’s most toxic traits. 
                    He is quick to explain that his growing preference for elite and expensive vehicles is not about peacocking success or impressing women, or padding his ego with emblems of masculine power. 
                    “A car guy,” he says, “wants to be known for understanding and knowing cars. Another guy would want to be seen in those cars. I'm not the latter.”
                </p>
                <p>Jean-Raymond’s had momentum all along. While living a highly public life in the “nice-candles-ass” world of fashion has been destabilizing, often existential, the designer’s love for cars has kept his history in sight, allowing him to stay focused, not only on what’s next, but on something more essential: why and with whom.
