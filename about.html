                <p>SOMETHING WRONG? is a formative movement to asking and addressing the negativity that we digest on a daily basis. In the midst of 2020, there has been countless outrages,
                    unexpected losses, frustrating outcomes and most importantly the negative feed of society, our own media turned against us BECAUSE of us. With all the unsettling trauma that has
                    leaked into the new decade, we have set ourselves on the lowest possible ledge. SOMETHING WRONG? asks, quite simply, 'is there something wrong?', which in the modern existence is 
                    most positively a yes, a hard, bolded and capitalized YES.
                </p>
                <p>However, it is important to address the belief that something always seems to be wrong. The connotation of this site is exactly what we should all be avoiding - 
                    feeding the negative energy to our soul, idle waiting for it to define our generation. Instead, we should think in terms of a balance of things. There are just as many good things as 
                    there are bad, yet we allow negativity to bulldoze the building with positivity barely breaking drywall. This mindset within us all digs deeper than we wish, and it's a shame we even 
                    let ourselves get to this point.
                </p>
                <p>SOMETHING WRONG? is a public news forum, tailored specifically for the artful, creative freelancer that happens to passionate about something that they can't quite get off their tongue. 
                    Inspired by the street culture of the perservered, the fashion designers who put out the oh-so-ridiculous price tagged masterpieces, the creators of the universal language of music, or 
                    even simply the next person in line who wants to make life better for others by sharing their own vision of the world. SOMETHING WRONG? is rich with expression, SOMETHING WRONG? is the 
                    stepping stone into realizing our mistakes, SOMETHING WRONG? is the "influencer" that everyone aspires and dreams to experience. Of course it sounds fantasy, this is just a measly news site. Maybe it is. 
                    We don't think it is. We have realized those that inspired us had to take a first step, pushing through the cocoon and birthing free. How can putting your thoughts to words spell out the first small steps towards success?
                    We didn't know that it would until we did it. So you should too.
                </p>
                <p>We want to encourage as many people to make a difference. And to us, the best way that can be done is by sending us your mastery of wordplay, so it can shine to all the like-minded
                    individuals who are looking for their first small step, their one of many.
