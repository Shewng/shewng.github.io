                <p>Antwaun Sargent speaks in profile. I met the 31-year-old writer and critic at the Aperture gallery located in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, surrounded by the exhibition that accompanies his recently released book, The New Black Vanguard: Photography Between Art and Fashion—on view until January 18. 
                    At every image, Sargent stood beside me, holding his fingers over the bow of his mouth while he thought of what he wanted to show me, or extended his whole hand towards the object of his attention, his face turned towards the photo so he could speak towards what he saw.
                </p>
                <p>In the same way Sargent holds his head, his perspective has always taken the form of the profile: his work is dedicated to seeing, with panoramic clarity, the way artists exist in their element. 
                    Sargent has written for publications such as The New Yorker, The New York Times, GQ, and The Nation; he’s spoken at Atlanta Contemporary, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Art Gallery of Ontario; and written exhibition catalogues for artists like Arthur Jafa and Mickalene Thomas. 
                    The New Black Vanguard, his first book, is a portfolio collection featuring 15 photographers including Renell Medrano, Nadine Ijewere, Daniel Obasi, and Ruth Ossai, among others. 
                    As Sargent writes in the essay that serves as the book’s introduction, they comprise a collective forming a, “new Black vanguard of photographers, who are working internationally, across the African diaspora, and using their cameras to create contemporary portrayals of Black life that are reframing representational paradigms.”
                </p>
                <p>Here, the brands’ designers and creative directors discuss how they approach their work, and share some thoughts on what’s in store for the future.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Sargent intended his essay as a critique, his argument situating a community between a past still revealing itself and a future still unknown. 
                    The New Black Vanguard is not just asking the question of who takes the photo—it is the question of how much it takes to make a photo. 
                    In the intersection of art and fashion, commerce reveals itself as an unlikely and unwelcome influence. 
                    Sargent and the assembly of photographers in The New Black Vanguard reveal how within such contrast beauty can be its most honest. 
                    Many of the images included originated in or are informed by fashion, a deliberate rethinking, writes Sargent, of “how the fashion image can be less censorious and more reflective of real life.” 
                    There are Deana Lawson’s photographs of Rihanna for Garage, Adrienne Raquel’s portfolio of Lizzo in Playboy, and Tyler Mitchell’s portraits of Beyoncé, which made him the first Black photographer to shoot a cover by Vogue. 
                    Under Sargent’s curation, the exhibition also features vitrines filled with print magazines. 
                    Visitors can walk around one glass display case and see issues of contemporary magazines like FADER or Niijournal, and in the other are collector’s items, such as original editions of Ebony, Hue, and Jet placed beside the Black Photographers Annual 1973.
                </p>
                <p>“Fashion,” Sargent writes, “is a malleable document.” The family photograph at Sears and the billboard hanging over Times Square can both, to Sargent, become a fashion image. 
                    “There’s a great diversity within the image, but also in the construction,” he explained to me. Sargent included photographers who take still lifes or portraits, street style or landscape, but many of them share the same desire for fashion to be in the foreground. 
                    “We all look at these images and take something different from it,” he said, “It has this magic to it, this power to it.”
                </p>
                <p>The rare writer who is also willing to be the subject of a profile, Sargent and I spoke about reading, writing, and the many different acts of organizing happening in and around art institutions. 
                    The conversation moved between the worlds inside the photos on the wall, and the world still waiting outside.
